#### Description:
Factorial Calculator
Project Overview
The Factorial Calculator is a simple C program designed to calculate the factorial of a positive integer provided as a command-line argument. The project consists of two main files: factorial.c and README.md. The C file contains the program code, including the factorial function and the main function for execution. The README file provides detailed documentation about the project, explaining its purpose, the structure of the code, and any notable design choices.
File Descriptions
factorial.c
This file contains the C code for the Factorial Calculator. It includes standard input/output and standard library headers. The program defines a recursive factorial function to calculate the factorial of a given integer. The main function serves as the entry point, validating command-line arguments, converting input to an integer, and calling the factorial function. Error messages are displayed for incorrect inputs, and the result is printed to the console.
README.md
The README file serves as comprehensive documentation for the Factorial Calculator project. It begins with a brief overview of the project's purpose and functionality. It then provides detailed explanations of the components in the factorial.c file, such as the header files, the recursive factorial function, and the main function.

Additionally, the README explains the rationale behind specific design choices, such as the decision to use recursion for calculating the factorial and the choice of error messages. It encourages users to follow the provided usage instructions and offers an example command for running the program. The README emphasizes the importance of allocating sufficient time and energy to thoroughly document the project and express pride in the work.
Design Choices
Recursive Factorial Function
The decision to implement the factorial calculation using recursion was made for simplicity and clarity of the code. While an iterative approach is also valid, recursion provides an elegant solution that aligns with the mathematical definition of factorial
Error Handling
The program includes robust error handling to ensure a positive integer is provided as input. Error messages guide users on correct usage, enhancing the user experience.
Usage Instructions
To use the Factorial Calculator, compile the factorial.c file and run the executable from the command line. Provide a positive integer as a command-line argument to calculate its factorial. For example: This will output: "The factorial of 5 is 120."
Conclusion
The Factorial Calculator is a simple yet well-documented C program. The README.md file serves as a comprehensive guide, explaining the project's purpose, code structure, and design choices. Users are encouraged to follow the provided instructions for a smooth experience. The project demonstrates a commitment to clarity, robustness, and user-friendly error handling.
